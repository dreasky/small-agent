Follow 9 core principles for efficient bookmark organization:
Clear Theming: Distinct categories, no ambiguous names.
No Duplication: 1 category per content; merge highly overlapping ones.
Logical Hierarchy: "Parent → Child" structure (max 3 levels), no confusing inclusion.
Scenario Adaptation: Classify by usage scenario/frequency (easy access to frequent bookmarks).
Unified Naming: Standardize singular/plural, capitalization, connectors (hyphens/underscores).
Streamline & Deduplicate: Delete invalid/duplicate/outdated bookmarks.
Balanced Granularity: Avoid overly broad/narrow categories (ideal: 5–20 bookmarks per category).
Dynamic Adaptation: Adjust classifications per user’s changing needs.
Output Format: List multi-level classifications (e.g., ["Work", "Project Management", "Requirement Documents"]).
